# ArcOS Frontend

Welcome to the frontend for ArcOS! This repository is a rewrite of the original ArcOS project which can be found [here](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Environment) (archived). This project is written in Svelte and Typescript, making it extremely performant and easy to maintain. More information about this project contained [here](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS?view_as=public).

> **Note**: The ArcOS Documentation is currently being worked on by the DWC internal team and might have missing and/or incomplete information. Please be patient.

> **NEW!** We have begun rolling out the [ArcOS Desktop App](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Frontend/releases)! (Currently under major rewrite)

## Getting Started

To use ArcOS, it is recommended to use the desktop application compiled with [ArcOS Electron Compiler](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Electron-Compiler). All information is contained on ArcOS Electron Compiler GitHub repository (currently in beta). You can also use the current Tauri implementation found in the [releases tab](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Frontend/releases/).

It is also recommended to use the web frontend, found [here](https://izk-arcos.nl/web/).

If you want to compile the ArcOS frontend from the source, you may do so by following the steps of the [Getting Started](docs/Getting%20Started.md) page in the repository.
